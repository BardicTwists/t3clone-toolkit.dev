# Onboarding Page Implementation

## Overview
Created a new onboarding page at `/onboarding` that welcomes new users and allows them to select toolkits before entering the chat experience.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` (New)
- **Purpose**: Main onboarding page component
- **Features**:
  - Centered card layout similar to the login form design
  - Brief explanation of what toolkits are
  - Interactive toolkit selection using the same components as the main tools dialog 
  - Shows toolkit icons, names, descriptions, and available tools in tooltips
  - Configuration support for toolkits that require parameters
  - Visual indicator showing number of selected toolkits
  - "Continue to Chat" button that saves selections and redirects to main app

### 2. `/src/app/(chat)/page.tsx` (Modified) 
- **Purpose**: Added new user detection and redirect logic
- **Changes**:
  - Added check for users with no chat history (new users)
  - Automatically redirects new users to `/onboarding`
  - Uses tRPC API to check if user has any existing chats

## Key Features

### Toolkit Selection
- Uses the same `clientToolkits` from the existing codebase
- Reuses the same UI components as the main tools dialog
- Supports toolkits that require configuration (shows popup with form)
- Visual feedback for selected vs unselected toolkits

### Local Storage Integration
- Selected toolkits are saved to localStorage using `localStorageUtils.setToolkits()`
- When users enter the main chat app, their selected toolkits will be automatically loaded
- Uses the same storage format as the existing chat context

### User Experience
- Clean, centered card design matching the app's UI patterns
- Informative but concise explanation of toolkits
- Progressive disclosure - shows toolkit details on hover/click
- Clear call-to-action with "Continue to Chat" button

### New User Detection
- Automatically detects new users (those with no chat history)
- Seamlessly redirects to onboarding without manual intervention
- After completing onboarding, users go directly to the main chat interface

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- **UI**: Uses existing shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Popover, Tooltip, etc.)
- **State Management**: React useState for local component state
- **Navigation**: Next.js useRouter for programmatic navigation
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage via existing utilities
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing NextAuth setup

## Usage Flow
1. New user signs in for the first time
2. Main page detects they have no chat history
3. User is automatically redirected to `/onboarding`
4. User sees welcome message and toolkit explanation
5. User can browse and select desired toolkits
6. Selected toolkits are saved to localStorage
7. User clicks "Continue to Chat" and is taken to main app
8. Main app loads with their pre-selected toolkits

## Notes
- The redirect URI for new users is `/onboarding` as requested
- The implementation reuses existing components and patterns for consistency
- No database changes required - uses localStorage for toolkit preferences
- Compatible with existing chat context and toolkit management system
