# Chat Interface Updates

## Overview

Updated the chat interface to provide a better user experience with:

- Centered input box when there are no messages
- Welcome text above the input that moves with it
- Starter prompts below the input when there are no messages
- Smooth input position animation when transitioning between states
- All elements (greeting, input, starter prompts) move together as one unit

## Changes Made

### 1. StarterPrompts Component (`src/app/(chat)/_components/starter-prompts.tsx`)

- Displays 4 clickable prompt suggestions when no messages exist
- Prompts include:
  - "Help me write a professional email"
  - "Explain a complex topic simply"
  - "Generate creative ideas for my project"
  - "Review and improve my code"
- Clicking a prompt automatically sets it as input and submits the message
- Uses staggered animations for individual prompt buttons

### 2. Updated Chat Component (`src/app/(chat)/_components/chat.tsx`)

- Always renders the Messages component (for displaying actual messages)
- Uses single absolutely positioned container that includes:
  - **Greeting text** (only when no messages exist)
  - **Input form** (always present)
  - **Starter prompts** (only when no messages exist)
- Container animates between positions:
  - **No messages**: Positioned at center (50% from top)
  - **Has messages**: Positioned at bottom (1rem from bottom)
- All elements move together as one cohesive unit

### 3. Updated Messages Component (`src/app/(chat)/_components/messages/index.tsx`)

- Simplified to only handle message display
- Removed greeting component since it's now in the input container
- Maintains all existing message display functionality

## Animation Details

### Container Position Animation

- Single `motion.div` container with absolute positioning
- Animates between:
  - Center: `top: 50%, transform: translateY(-50%)`
  - Bottom: `bottom: 1rem, top: auto, transform: none`
- Spring animation with `stiffness: 300, damping: 30`

### Content Animations

- **Greeting**: Fades in/out with staggered text animation when no messages
- **Starter Prompts**: Fade in/out as container moves, individual buttons have staggered animation
- **Input**: Remains constant throughout (no separate animation)

## Technical Implementation

- **Same Input Component**: Uses identical `MultimodalInput` throughout
- **Single Container**: All UI elements (greeting, input, prompts) in one absolutely positioned container
- **Conditional Rendering**: Greeting and StarterPrompts only appear when `messages.length === 0`
- **Unified Movement**: Everything moves together, preventing alignment issues
- **Motion/React**: Uses existing animation library for smooth transitions

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistent Interface**: Same input component prevents UI jarring
2. **Unified Movement**: Greeting, input, and prompts move as one unit
3. **Perfect Alignment**: All elements stay properly aligned during transitions
4. **Better Onboarding**: Starter prompts help new users get started
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before

The implementation uses a single absolutely positioned container approach where the greeting, input, and starter prompts move together as one cohesive unit, providing perfect alignment and a seamless user experience.
