# E2B Toolkit Setup Guide

I've successfully created a complete E2B toolkit for running Python code in secure sandbox environments. Here's what was built and how to set it up:

## What Was Created

### 📁 Complete Toolkit Structure
```
src/toolkits/toolkits/e2b/
├── base.ts                 # Base toolkit configuration
├── client.tsx              # Client-side UI components  
├── server.ts               # Server-side business logic
├── README.md               # Detailed documentation
├── tools/
│   ├── tools.ts            # Tool enum definitions
│   └── run_code/
│       ├── base.ts         # Tool schema definitions
│       ├── client.tsx      # React UI components
│       └── server.ts       # Execution logic
└── components/             # (empty, for future components)
```

### 🔧 Integration Complete
- ✅ Added to toolkit registry (`shared.ts`)
- ✅ Registered in client toolkits (`client.ts`) 
- ✅ Registered in server toolkits (`server.ts`)
- ✅ Full TypeScript support with proper types

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install E2B Package
```bash
npm install @e2b/code-interpreter
```

### 2. Get E2B API Key
1. Visit [https://e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

### 3. Set Environment Variable
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
E2B_API_KEY=your_e2b_api_key_here
```

### 4. Ready to Use!
The toolkit will now be available in your application with the name **"Python Code Execution"**.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Secure Python execution** in isolated E2B sandboxes
- **Rich UI** with syntax highlighting and organized results
- **Full error handling** with helpful error messages
- **Jupyter-style support** for notebook-like code execution
- **Beautiful output display** for results, stdout, and stderr

## 🔍 Tool Details

### `run-code` Tool
- **Input**: `code` (string) - Python code to execute
- **Output**: 
  - `results` (array) - Execution results
  - `logs` (object) - stdout and stderr arrays

### Example Usage
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.show()
```

## 🎨 UI Components

- **CallComponent**: Shows code being executed with syntax highlighting
- **ResultComponent**: Displays results with organized sections for:
  - Execution results (JSON formatted)
  - Standard output logs
  - Error logs with appropriate styling
  - "Run More Code" action button

## 🔒 Security Features

- Isolated sandbox execution
- No host system access
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Secure API key handling

## 📖 Documentation

See `src/toolkits/toolkits/e2b/README.md` for detailed documentation including:
- Architecture overview
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security details
- Component specifications

## ⚠️ Notes

- The E2B package installation may require additional setup depending on your system
- Make sure your E2B API key has sufficient credits for code execution
- Sandbox execution has time limits for long-running code

The toolkit is now ready to use once you complete the setup steps above!
